    <h1>Day 1 - 01.01.22</h1>
    <p>
      I'm working on the shopping cart page today.
      <br />
      Here is the my miserable work:)
      <br />
      <a href="/Projects/Project_1_shopping_page/index.html">Project 01</a>
      <br />
      This project is about a shopping cart page.
      <br />
      Actually, this is a homework, it was given us by our teacher for a month
      ago. <br />
      I coudn't do that original time because I have a bad health status.
      <br />
      Right now, I was trying to do my project but I couldn't understand
      something and I just wanted to a break. <br />
      Maybe I won't finish the project today, I'm just trying to understand...
      <br />
      The project should be see like that:
      <br />

        I reach most of my may goals even it was a bitter sweet months for me.
        <br />
        I left the teaching profession after twelve years.
        <br />
        In a way I'm sad and yet I have another amazing journey waiting for me.
        <br />
        Congrulations Alper this is a good memory for us.
