    <h1>220603</h1>
    <p>
      Today, I worked on my bootcamp topics which are unities, overflow,
      background-images like that.
      <br />
      I didn't work coding for any projects because I didn't have enough time
      for them... I was trying to catch the regular schedule but it will be
      impossible for me.
      <br />
      Actually, working on any projects, it doesn't matter for me.
