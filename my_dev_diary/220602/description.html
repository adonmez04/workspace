      Today, I'm working on my website's homepage.
      <br />
      It looks like my project 01, it was about a table and I'm coding my
      homepage as a table.
      <br />
      <br />
      Yesterday, I couldn't understand some properties about the table tag and I
      didn't want to search on google because I wondered if I can find a
      solution, but I couldn't. But today, I've searched on google about the
      problem and I've found a solution and then I will be able to build a
      homepage as a table.

      I always check geeksforgeeks.com for any information. I think, this
      website has a lot of beneficial articles. I like to read the article, not
      just specific information, that's why this website is good, because their
      articles are always long and deep information.
      <br />
      <br />
      I found the solution in here about my problem.
