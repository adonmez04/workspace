      <p>
        Actually, this is a homework, it was given us by our teacher for a month
        ago. <br />
        I coudn't do that original time because I have a bad health status.
        <br />

      <p>
        Right now, I was trying to do my project but I couldn't understand
        something and I just wanted to a break. <br />
        Maybe I won't finish the project today, I'm just trying to understand...
      </p>

        The project should be see like that:
